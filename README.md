# ByteCoin


## Description
A Bitcoin price reporter iOS app. It gives users the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies. The latest prices are gotten from Coin 
API which is a platform that provides cryptocurrency market data. I use URLSession to make a network request and I parse the JSON got back into a swift object
so it can be displayed in the User Interface.
